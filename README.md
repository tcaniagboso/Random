# Random Programming Projects

Some programming projects I have been working on.
The first one is a 'Spell-Checker' application that takes in a text file as an input. The program makes use of an installed English dictionary package to determine if a given word exists in English language. The Spell-Checker application runs through every word in a text file one by one and determines if it exists in the English dictionary or not. Once the program spots a word that doesn’t exist in the English Dictionary Package, it assumes that the word is misspelled and makes suggestions to the user. The user now has the option to accept or ignore the suggestions by answering ‘Y’ or ‘N’. If the user answers ‘Y’ the program replaces the misspelled word in the file with the new word, but if the user continuously answers ‘N’ for a certain word, the program suggests other possible replacements until it runs out of possible replacements, then leaves the word the way it is and moves on to the next misspelled word. When the program is done reading and writing to the file, it creates an updated text file with the corrected spellings and asks the user if they would like to run the program on another text file. If the user answers ‘Y’ the program will ask for the name of the text file, but if the user answers ‘N’ the program will stop running.
